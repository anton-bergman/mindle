## Project Vision

Mindle aims to create a combination of the popular word-guessing games Wordle, Ordel (Swedish version of Wordle), Stepdle, and potentially Worldle. This application will allow users to engage in word-guessing challenges, track their statistics, compete with others. The primary focus is to provide an enjoyable and challenging experience for users who are fans of word games.

## Technical tools

The Wordle Clone project will be developed using modern web development technologies. Some of the key tools and frameworks that will be utilized include:

- **Fullstack Framework:** Next.js will be used as the fullstack framework for developing both the frontend and backend of the application. Next.js provides server-side rendering, API routes, and other features essential for building robust web applications.
- **Database:** Firebase will serve as the NoSQL database for storing user data, game statistics, and other application-related information. Its real-time database capabilities make it suitable for handling dynamic data updates and synchronization across clients.

- **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication functionality will be integrated to handle user authentication securely. This will enable users to sign up, log in, and securely access their accounts using various authentication providers such as email/password, Google, or social media accounts.

- **Deployment:** Firebase Hosting will be used for deployment at the end of the project. Firebase Hosting provides a scalable and reliable platform for hosting web applications, ensuring high availability and fast content delivery to users.

- **Development:** Next.js will be configured with TypeScript to provide type safety and enhanced developer experience. React components will be built using Next.js's robust frontend capabilities.

- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS will be utilized for styling the user interface of the application. Tailwind CSS offers a utility-first approach, allowing developers to quickly build custom designs without writing custom CSS.

- **Version Control:** Git and GitLab will be used for version control, allowing for collaborative development and tracking of changes. The [EU git commit guidelines](https://ec.europa.eu/component-library/v1.15.0/eu/docs/conventions/git/) will be followed for all commits, ensuring consistency and clarity in commit messages.

## Features

The project will include the following features:

- **Combination of Games:** Incorporating elements from Wordle, Ordel, Stepdle, and potentially Worldle to provide a unique and engaging gameplay experience.
- **User Authentication:** Users will be able to create accounts and log in using a username.

- **Statistics Tracking:** The application will track various statistics for each user, including streaks, number of attempts used, time taken to complete challenges, and total number of games played.

- **Friendship System:** Users will have the option to befriend other players. A leaderboard will be available to view the top players among friends, as well as a global leaderboard for all players.

- **Daily Game Count:** The application will track the total number of games played each day, providing insights into user activity and engagement levels.
